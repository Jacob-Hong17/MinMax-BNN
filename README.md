# MinMax-BNN
Minimax Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) . 
The code here provides some experiment results for the paper "Minimax Bayesian Neural Networks" (Code based on CTRL-LDR model), the corresponding results can be found in the jupyter notebook.
Minimax BNNs is a conservative formulation in contrast to the classical BNNs, it controls the variance by the minimax loss requirements through a scalar called "radius", and this quantify how large the maximal coding rate reduction loss is
used in the closed-looped NNs. For more information, please see the paper.
